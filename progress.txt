Progress Update - SHIELD App

Completed:
- Added Firebase initialization module that exports shared auth/db/storage instances for the app.
- Replaced the starter Next.js page with the SHIELD experience shell, wiring onboarding, auth, dashboard, lessons, Ask Shield, and profile flows.
- Exposed the Context Builder via navigation and dashboard quick actions, integrating it into the main routing state machine.
- Integrated Firebase Auth (email/password, Google, and guest) plus `onAuthStateChanged` so the shell reacts to real sessions.
- Replaced mock dashboard/lessons/profile data with Firestore subscriptions for `lessons` and `users/{uid}`, including lesson detail fetching.
- Added pending dependencies (`lucide-react`, `tailwindcss`) and removed the unused Tailwind import from `globals.css` to unblock the Next.js build.
- Declared the `motion` package dependency so motion-based components resolve at build time.
- Removed the unused Tailwind-based `components/ui` and `components/figma` directories and dropped Tailwind dependencies to ensure the app is purely CSS-module driven.
- Restored the design token custom properties (spacing, radii, shadows, etc.) in `globals.css` so CSS Modules render with the intended Figma spacing/visual system.
- Hooked lesson notes and Ask Shield “Add to Notes” actions into Firestore via `arrayUnion`, so user notes persist across sessions and display in the Profile tab.
- Track lesson progress in Firestore: opening a lesson records in-progress state, and the “Mark Complete” action in Lesson Detail updates progress so dashboard + lesson cards reflect real study history.
- Persisted onboarding + theme state via localStorage and Firestore so returning users skip onboarding immediately and their preferred theme applies before Firebase hydration.
- Added a `UserProvider` context that listens to Firebase Auth + `profiles/{uid}`, exposing `useUser()` for idiomatic access to `{ user, profile, loading, refreshProfile, logout }` across the app.

Planned Next Steps:
- Add integration tests or runtime checks once Firebase connections are stable to validate onboarding → auth → lessons → notes flows.

Latest Note:
- With onboarding/theme persistence done, next up is test coverage—start with `npm run lint`/`npm run dev`, then consider Playwright or Cypress flows once backend data is solid.
- Testing tip: run `npm run lint` and `npm run dev` locally (after `npm install`) to ensure TypeScript types check out, Firebase calls succeed with your env vars, and note/progress updates appear in Firestore.
